## Frequently Asked Questions 

### The nav bar is conflicting with an existing navigation menu!

Since every theme is different, its possible that you may have to "hide" the existing menu if its conflicting. The first thing you could try is simply identifying the container class or identifier for the navigation menu you want to hide. Then modify your theme's CSS to "display:none" that selector.
